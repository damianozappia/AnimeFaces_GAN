## Generative Adversarial Network for the creation of anime faces

This project has been developed for the Vision and Perception course at Sapienza, and the aim was to build a GAN able to generate from scratch faces of anime, with the ability to overcome the non convergence problems that raises over the 64x64 pixels resolution, and adopting strategies that allowed the generation of 128x128 pixels images, with a good level of detail and realism. 
The implementation details and choices can be found in
